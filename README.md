🎮 Hi! I'm Sajmon — a passionate game development enthusiast and computer science student at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń.

🧠 I’m especially into game AI and procedural level generation.

💻 I like building things, learning by doing, and sharing knowledge — I’m actively involved in the Computer Science Student's Association at my university.

🛠️ I enjoy working in teams, using GitHub for collaboration, and exploring new tools and technologies.
